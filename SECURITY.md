# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

MINDLENS is currently in early development. Security updates will be provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |

Once we reach version 1.0, we will maintain security support for the latest major version and one previous major version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue

Security vulnerabilities should not be disclosed publicly until they have been addressed.

### 2. Report privately

Send an email to **security@mindlens.dev** with:
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if you have one)

### 3. Include relevant information

Please include as much information as possible:
- MINDLENS version affected
- Operating system and version
- Browser version (if web-related)
- Code samples or proof-of-concept (if applicable)

## Security Response Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure with you
5. **Release**: We will release a security update

## Response Timeline

- **48 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **5 business days**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **30 days**: Target for fix development and release (may vary based on complexity)

## Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

### Coordinated Disclosure

We believe in coordinated disclosure:
- We will work with security researchers to understand and fix vulnerabilities
- We will credit researchers (with their permission) in our security advisories
- We ask for reasonable time to develop and deploy fixes before public disclosure

### Public Disclosure

After a fix is released:
- We will publish a security advisory
- We will update our changelog
- We will notify users through appropriate channels

## Security Considerations for Contributors

### Code Review

All code changes go through security-focused review:
- Input validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Data sanitization
- Secure coding practices

### Dependencies

We monitor our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:
- Regular dependency updates
- Automated vulnerability scanning
- Security audits of critical dependencies

### Plugin Security

MINDLENS plugins run in sandboxed environments:
- Limited API access
- Permission-based system
- Code review for official plugins
- Community reporting for malicious plugins

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

- **Sandboxed Plugins**: Plugins run with limited permissions
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Communications**: All network communications use encryption
- **File System Protection**: Limited file system access with proper permissions

### Planned Security Features

- **Digital Signatures**: Code signing for all official releases
- **Auto-Updates**: Secure automatic update mechanism
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: For cloud features (when available)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Installation
- Download MINDLENS only from official sources
- Verify digital signatures when available
- Keep your installation up to date

### Plugin Usage
- Only install plugins from trusted sources
- Review plugin permissions before installation
- Report suspicious plugin behavior

### Data Protection
- Use strong passwords for cloud features
- Keep sensitive project data encrypted
- Regular backups of important projects

## Bug Bounty Program

We are considering a bug bounty program for future releases. Details will be announced when the program launches.

## Contact Information

- **Security Email**: security@mindlens.dev
- **PGP Key**: [Available on request]
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for acknowledgment
