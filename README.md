# MindLens

**MindLens** is an interactive environment for designing and visualizing application architecture, allowing seamless switching between abstraction layers, from business logic to code implementation. Our goal is to connect the architect's thought process with the developer's code, enabling smooth integration between various abstraction levels and real-world implementation.

🔮 **Mission**: To make software design and development more transparent, interactive, and flexible. We aim to help architects, developers, and designers synchronize their actions based on shared principles and visual models.

## 🚀 Motto
_"Architecture in your hands. Code you can see. Thoughts you design."_

## 📖 What is this?

**MindLens** provides a unique tool for designing systems with the ability to move between abstraction levels, from conceptual diagrams to final code implementation. We offer:
- Interactive diagrams and charts for analyzing the application architecture.
- Synchronization between business logic, architecture, and code.
- Code generation from models and integration with IDEs and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🔑 Key Features:
- **Interactive Layers**: Switch between abstraction layers (from business logic to bytes).
- **IDE Integration**: Synchronization with code via plugins for popular IDEs.
- **Models and Dependencies**: Visualize data flows, components, and dependencies.
- **Code Generation**: Automatically generate templates, interfaces, and tests based on architecture.
- **Live Updates**: Automatically update all layers when changes occur at any level.

## 🔄 How it Works

1. **Models**: The system starts with a semantic model of architecture, which includes entities, relationships, and layers.
2. **Visualization**: Models are transformed into interactive graphs and diagrams.
3. **Generation**: Based on the architecture, templates, interfaces, tests, and documentation are generated.
4. **Implementation**: The application syncs with the actual code and updates in real-time.
