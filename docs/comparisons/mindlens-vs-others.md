## Understanding the AGPLv3 License

The GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPLv3) is designed to ensure that modifications to the software remain open source. Key points:

- You can freely use, modify, and distribute MINDLENS
- If you modify MINDLENS, you must make your modified source code publicly available
- If you provide MINDLENS as a network service (like SaaS), you must make the complete source code available to users
- The "copyleft" provision requires that any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPLv3

The AGPLv3 license is ideal for:
- Open source projects
- Educational institutions
- Research organizations
- Individual developers learning and contributing

## Understanding the Commercial License

Our commercial license provides additional freedoms and benefits for business use:

- No requirement to disclose your source code
- Permission to embed MINDLENS in proprietary software
- Legal certainty for enterprise use
- Priority technical support
- Input on feature roadmap
- Custom development options

The commercial license is ideal for:
- Enterprise software vendors
- SaaS companies
- Organizations with strict IP protection requirements
- Companies building commercial products on MINDLENS

## Determining Which License You Need

You need a commercial license if:

1. You want to integrate MINDLENS into a product without disclosing your source code
2. You're developing proprietary software that uses MINDLENS
3. Your organization has policies against using AGPL software
4. You require dedicated support and priority bug fixes
5. You want input on the MINDLENS roadmap
