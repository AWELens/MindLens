# MINDLENS: Legal FAQ

## Licensing Questions

### What licenses are available for MINDLENS?
MINDLENS is available under two license options:

1. **GNU Affero General Public License v3 (AGPLv3)** - For open source usage
2. **Commercial License** - For proprietary/closed-source applications

This dual-licensing model provides flexibility for different use cases while supporting ongoing development.

### When do I need a commercial license?
You need a commercial license if:

- You want to include MINDLENS in a closed-source product
- You need to modify MINDLENS without publishing your changes
- Your organization has policies against using AGPL software
- You want commercial support and priority bug fixes
- You want to remove the requirement to share source code of your application

### What does the AGPLv3 license require me to do?
When using MINDLENS under the AGPLv3 license:

- You must provide the complete source code of your modified version to users
- If you offer MINDLENS as a network service (e.g., SaaS), you must make the complete source code available to users of that service
- You must include a copy of the AGPLv3 license and copyright notice with your distribution
- Any derivative works must also be licensed under AGPLv3

### Can I use MINDLENS in my company's internal tools under AGPLv3?
Yes, but with important conditions:

- If the tool is only used internally and never provided to external users, you can use MINDLENS under AGPLv3
- However, you must still make the source code of your modifications available within your company
- If you ever provide access to the tool to external users (even via a network), you must provide them with the complete source code

### What's the difference between GPL and AGPL in practical terms?
The key difference is the "network use" provision:

- **GPL**: Only requires source distribution when you distribute the software itself
- **AGPL**: Also requires source distribution when you provide the software as a service over a network

This distinction is important for SaaS and web applications where users interact with the software remotely.

### What are the terms of the commercial license?
Commercial licenses are customized based on your specific needs, but generally include:

- Rights to use MINDLENS in proprietary applications
- No requirement to disclose your source code
- Options for different deployment scales
- Support and maintenance options
- Custom development and integration services (optional)

### Can I try MINDLENS commercially before purchasing a license?
Yes, we offer:

- 30-day evaluation licenses for testing in commercial environments
- Startup discounts for early-stage companies
- Academic discounts for educational institutions
- Non-profit organization discounts

### Do I need a commercial license for educational use?
No, educational and academic use is fully supported under the AGPLv3 license. We encourage the use of MINDLENS in teaching and research environments.

## Open Source Questions

### Can I contribute to MINDLENS while using it commercially?
Absolutely! We welcome contributions regardless of how you're using MINDLENS. All contributions to the core project must be licensed under AGPLv3 to maintain the integrity of the project's licensing model.

### Who owns the copyright to contributions?
Contributors retain the copyright to their contributions, but license them to the project under the AGPLv3. For significant contributions, we may ask for a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) to clarify these terms.

### How can I use MINDLENS in an open source project?
MINDLENS can be used in any open source project that is compatible with AGPLv3. Note that this effectively requires your project to also be AGPLv3 licensed due to the viral nature of the license.

### Are there any usage restrictions beyond the licenses?
We do not impose additional restrictions beyond those in the licenses. However, we do ask that you don't use the MINDLENS name or logo in ways that suggest endorsement without our permission.

## Commercial Questions

We offer flexible options ranging from single-developer licenses to enterprise-wide agreements.
