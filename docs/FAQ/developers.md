# MINDLENS: Developer FAQ

## General Questions

### What is MINDLENS?
MINDLENS is an interactive architectural framework that bridges the gap between abstract architectural thinking, code implementation, and runtime behavior. It provides a unified model where changes are synchronized across all layers, from architectural intent to actual running code.

### What problem does MINDLENS solve?
MINDLENS addresses the disconnect between architectural design and implementation. Traditional approaches involve separate tools for modeling, coding, and monitoring, leading to architecture documentation becoming outdated and implementations diverging from intended design. MINDLENS maintains synchronization across all these layers.

### What programming languages does MINDLENS support?
Currently, MINDLENS provides first-class support for TypeScript/JavaScript projects. Support for additional languages is on our roadmap, with Python, Java, and C# being prioritized based on community feedback.

### Is MINDLENS ready for production use?
MINDLENS is currently in its early stages of development. We recommend using it for exploratory projects, proof-of-concepts, and non-critical applications while we work toward a stable 1.0 release.

## Technical Questions

### How does the layer synchronization work?
MINDLENS uses a combination of AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing, code generation, and a central graph-based data model to maintain synchronization. When changes occur in any layer:

1. The change is captured and represented in the central graph model
2. Transformation engines convert these changes to appropriate representations for other layers
3. Bi-directional synchronization ensures all layers reflect the latest state

### Can I integrate MINDLENS with my existing codebase?
Yes. MINDLENS includes tools for reverse engineering existing codebases into the architectural model. The process includes:

1. AST scanning of your codebase
2. Initial structure inferencing
3. Manual refinement of architectural intentions
4. Progressive enhancement of the model

For large codebases, we recommend an incremental adoption approach, starting with newer or more isolated components.

### What visualization options are available?
MINDLENS offers multiple visualization perspectives:

- **2D Flow**: React Flow-based interactive diagrams
- **3D View**: Three.js architectural maps showing system structures
- **Code View**: Side-by-side code and model representations
- **Timeline View**: Historical evolution of architectural components

Each perspective can be customized with filters, layouts, and style configurations.

### How extensible is MINDLENS?
MINDLENS has a plugin-based architecture designed for extensibility:

- **Layer Plugins**: Add new projection layers
- **Visualization Plugins**: Custom views and representations
- **Integration Plugins**: Connect to external systems (Git, CI/CD, etc.)
- **Transformation Plugins**: Custom transformations between layers

Plugins are developed using a hook-based system with TypeScript interfaces for type safety.

### What are the system requirements?
- **Development Environment**: Node.js 16+ and npm/yarn
- **Optional**: For C++ accelerated modules: CMake and C++17 compiler
- **Browser**: Modern browser with WebGL support for advanced visualizations
- **Recommended**: 8GB+ RAM for larger projects

### How does MINDLENS handle database schemas and migrations?
Database schemas can be represented as nodes in the architecture with special properties. Schema migrations can be tracked as timeline events on these nodes. MINDLENS doesn't replace dedicated database migration tools but can integrate with them through plugins.

### Can I use MINDLENS with microservice architectures?
Yes, MINDLENS is particularly valuable for microservice architectures. It can:

- Visualize service boundaries and interactions
- Track API contracts between services
- Monitor runtime communication patterns
- Highlight potential areas of coupling or cohesion issues

## Implementation Questions

### How do I create my first architectural model?
1. Initialize a MINDLENS project: `npx mindlens init`
2. Define key architectural contexts using the UI or DSL
3. Add use cases and services within these contexts
4. Generate code scaffolds: `npx mindlens generate`
5. Implement business logic in the generated code
6. Run your application with MINDLENS monitoring: `npx mindlens start`

### How do I add a new use case to an existing model?
1. Open the MINDLENS visual editor
2. Create a node of type `UseCase` in the appropriate context
3. Define inputs, outputs, and dependencies
4. Click "Scaffold" to generate implementation files
5. Implement the business logic in the generated files
6. The changes will be reflected across all layers

### How do I integrate with my IDE?
MINDLENS provides extensions for:

- VS Code (available now)
- JetBrains IDEs (in development)
- Other editors via Language Server Protocol

These extensions provide:
- Inline visualization of architectural context
- Quick navigation between model and code
- Architecture validation warnings
- Suggestion and auto-completion based on architectural intent

### How do I share my architectural models with my team?
MINDLENS models can be:

1. Stored in version control as part of your project
2. Exported as interactive HTML reports
3. Shared via the upcoming MINDLENS Cloud service
4. Visualized in real-time during collaborative sessions

### How do I track architectural decisions over time?
MINDLENS includes a timeline view that:

- Records significant architectural changes
- Captures decision points and rationales
- Shows evolution of components and relationships
- Integrates with ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

## Performance and Scaling

### How does MINDLENS perform with large codebases?
MINDLENS uses several strategies for performance with large codebases:

- Incremental parsing and processing
- Lazy loading of visualization components
- WebWorker-based background processing
- Optional C++ acceleration for graph algorithms
- Efficient delta updates rather than full reprocessing

For very large monoliths (1M+ LOC), we recommend a modular adoption approach.

### Can MINDLENS handle distributed team workflows?
Yes, MINDLENS supports distributed teams through:

- Git-based workflows for model changes
- Collaborative editing features (coming soon)
- Conflict resolution for simultaneous model editing
- Comment and discussion threads on architectural elements
- Integration with common team collaboration tools

### Is there a limit to the size of projects MINDLENS can handle?
The practical limits depend on your hardware:

- **Client-side only**: Up to ~100K LOC with standard hardware
- **With server acceleration**: Up to 1M+ LOC
- **With C++ modules**: Significant performance improvements for graph operations

We're continually working on performance optimizations for larger projects.
